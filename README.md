# Interpretability Ground Truth Datasets (IGTD)
- This repo aims at creating an interpretability ground truth datasets 
- The datasets are created based on a combination of different features/label rules.
- Each dataset contains multiple rules
- The datasets created to have different levels of complexity 
- The ground truth datasets focus on binary classification ML
